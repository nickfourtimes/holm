## About

Meant to be a wander game about traversal, providing a huge environment to explore at a very leisurely pace.

I was hoping to experiment with landscape design, creating a variety of small microbiomes and subtle gradations of place. Oddly enough, the inspiration for this was the 2006 adaptation of _The Wicker Man_, which, if nothing else, had a number of compelling settings.

The idea was that you would start at one tip of the crescent-shaped island, and across the bay on the other tip would be your ultimate goal, a large manor of some kind. Taking the long way around, you would visit various other settlements and construct a history of successive lived generations in this place. Arriving at the manor you'd find... who knows, ghosts, probably.

The main mechanic I was interested in, besides wandering, was the folding of space at certain points on the map. Playing it now, you start just down the hill from a tall tower. Approaching it, you're teleported to the top (loading screen here, &c). From that vantage point, you can see a few other towers on the horizon. Initially, there'd be nothing to do besides observe the other towers; by the end they would serve as a means of instant point-to-point travel, effectively collapsing the space that had previously taken you a very long time to traverse.

Anyway, for the time being you can warp immediately to any tower, and you don't already have to be on top of a tower to do so. Just point your crosshair at a tower, and once it brightens, left-click the mouse to travel to that point.

Made with Unity 2019.1.0f2.

## Controls

WADS to walk around, mouse to look.

Controls begin inverted, as nature intended, but you can hit I to flip them this way and that.

If your crosshair touches one of three towers, it will be highlighted; left-click to warp to that point.

## Plugins 

I'd used or intended to use a couple of commercial plugins off the Asset Store, which I've removed from this public repo. They are:

* AllSky
* Build Report
* First Person Exploration Kit
* Gaia

Free plugins are still included.
