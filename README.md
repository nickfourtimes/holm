# HOLM

## About

This is an old prototype, intended as...
* a wander game about traversal, providing a huge environment to explore at a very leisurely pace
* a canvas to experiment with landscape design, creating a variety of small microbiomes and subtle gradations of place. Oddly enough, the inspiration for this was the 2006 adaptation of _The Wicker Man_, which, if nothing else, had a number of compelling locations.

The primary goal is to traverse the island, from tip to tip, at a slow walking pace, visiting various settlements along the way and constructing a history of successive lived generations in this place. Arriving at the opposite end you find... who knows, ghosts, probably.

The tall towers placed around the island are a form of fast-travel, folding the space for the player. They might have a purpose some day. Anyway, for the time being you can warp immediately to any tower, and you don't already have to be on top of a tower to do so. Just point your crosshair at one, and once it brightens, left-click the mouse to travel to that point.

## Gameplay

Not much to speak of: just walk around and warp between the towers on the island. Proof of a thin concept.

## Controls

WADS to walk around, mouse to look.

Controls begin inverted, as nature intended, but you can hit `I` to flip them this way and that.

If your crosshair touches one of towers, it will be highlighted; left-click to warp to that point.

## Links 

I'd started with some commercial plugins off the Asset Store, which I've removed from this public repo. They are:

* [AllSky](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/textures-materials/sky/allsky-200-sky-skybox-set-10109)
* [First Person Exploration Kit](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/templates/systems/first-person-exploration-kit-60434)
* [Fungus](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/templates/systems/fungus-34184)
* [Gaia 2](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/terrain/gaia-2-terrain-scene-generator-42618)

Free plugins are still included.

The prototype as of September 2019 is up on [itch.io](https://nicknicknicknick.itch.io/holm).
